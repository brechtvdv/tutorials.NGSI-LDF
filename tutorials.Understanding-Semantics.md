This tutorial introduces basics of vocabularies to describe things in a certain domain. 
These vocabularies ensure that applications speak the same language (are semantically interoperable) and are one of the prerequisites to publish Linked Data.
For NGSI-LDF, which adds a scalable API layer on top of a NGSI-LD context broker, data must be described with vocabularies in order that the context broker's Linked Data can be consumed by other Digital Twin components. 

We will introduce the RDF data model and investigate how these are applied in the *Schema.org*, *NGSI-LD*, *OSLO* and *W3C* ecosystems. 
Then, we will explain what Application Profiles are and how they can help developers achieving data compliance.

In the next tutorial, we will create a OSLO-compliant data snippet of a Building which we will use further in the tutorials.
